  <p class="p1"> Happy Birthday, DAFNAAAAAAAAAAAAA! <br>
     On this special day,<br>
      I wish you endless joy, laughter that fills the air,<br>
       and moments that become cherished memories,<br>
        less Nigerian mentees in your life and more real-life<br>
         meeting with your friends from Nobel!<br>
          I'm grateful for having you in my life <br>
          (who if not you would've just sent me<br>
           the links to the meetings and said JOIN).<br>
            May this year bring you everything <br>
            your heart desires and more.<br>
             HAPPY BIRTHDAAAAY! </p>

  <p class="p1"> Happy birthday dear Dafna!! <br>
    You are the life of our class,<br>
     party even when not speaking,<br>
      you radiate this pleasant energy.<br> 
     If you ever ever feel low, and think being alone<br>
      will heal you just do it.<br>
       Be loud, be silent, be chivalrous, <br>
        be rulebreaker, be sad, be happy, be guilty, be headstrong,<br>
         be all of you Dafna, live the moment.<br>
           Stay healthy, happy and prosperous!</p>

       with your positive energy (unlike me),<br>
